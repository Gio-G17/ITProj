          <h2>What is the World Wide Web</h2>
          <p>
            The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is “a wide-area
            hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal
            access to a large universe of documents.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Though most everyday users wrongly assume that the WWW and the
            Internet are the same, they are actually very different. Unlike the
            WWW, which was developed much later in the 1980s, the Internet began
            as a means for government researchers to share information in the
            1960s.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article id="beginning">
          <h2>How it all Began <br /><br /></h2>
          <p>
            The WWW was first conceptualized in 1946 when Murray Leinster wrote
            a short story in which he imagined that there would be computers in
            every home, each with access to a central device from which they
            could retrieve information. The story does capture the idea of a
            vast information network accessible to everyone in their homes,
            despite having some differences from how the Web operates today.
          </p>
          <p>
            The execution of the WWW as a concept didn't emerge until around 40
            years later. It was in the year 1980 when Tim Berners-Lee, the
            inventor of WWW, worked on a project known as ENQUIRE. This project
            required Lee to share information with his peers worldwide, and he
            found no other easy or quick way. Consequently, he put together a
            proposal for a centralized database containing links to other
            documents in 1989. Despite this being the ideal solution for Lee and
            his colleagues, nobody was interested in it, and nobody paid
            attention—except his boss at the time, Mike Sendall. Though Lee's
            initial proposal was not immediately accepted, and Sendall wrote
            “vague but exciting” on its cover, he supported Lee by giving him
            time and encouraged him to implement the new system in their next
            project. The World Wide Web was the only name that stuck after
            several other suggestions.<br /><br />

            <br /><br />
            By December 1990, Lee had teamed up with another physicist named
            Robert Cailliau and had revised his initial idea.3 They had the idea
            to create web pages by fusing hypertext with the internet, but no
            one at the time realized how successful this concept could be. Lee
            persisted in creating the first web browser, HTTP, HTML, and HTML,
            despite all odds. The WWW project was introduced to the public on
            June 8, 1991, and the first web page was published online on August
            6 of that same year.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can now share information with anyone, anywhere in the world,
            thanks to the creation of the WWW. It began with the fundamentals of
            sharing a document, but it has since developed into tools that
            enable us to enhance and improve our lives. The world can access the
            web for free thanks to Tim Berners-Lee, who created it as an
            open-source project.6 As a result, the business and employment
            worlds are developing simultaneously as the new internet generation
            is rapidly taking off. More and more people are eager to pursue
            brand-new career opportunities in today's society, and many are
            honing their technological skills. All of this was pioneered by Tim
            Berners Lee!
